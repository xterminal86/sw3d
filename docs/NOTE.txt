GitHub pages won't render math.

Trying to fix it is a pain in the ass: you can create folder "_layouts" with
"default.html" template file there inside of which you can specify loading of
MathJax or whatever the fuck inside the <head> tag. Now formulas will render,
but you lose CSS styles and page becomes not mobile friendly.

Putting "head.html" inside "_includes" does nothing.

Viewing .md files directly in project's repository works fine though, but some
formulas don't render.

I tried to copypaste some styles from existing external ones, so hopefully shit
works now. At least to some degree.
