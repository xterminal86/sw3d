# Prologue

Welcome to part 0 of our software 3D renderer tutorial!

This part will cover the preparations. As mentioned, we'll be using C++ and SDL2 and it's expected that you're familiar with these. When needed I'll be highlighting certain important parts of code that I believe hold importance but won't be copypasting sheets of it here so that you won't get lost. Instead I'll post a link to source file in question which you can peruse at your leisure if necessary at some later point in time.

## SDL2 project setup

You will need to create simple SDL2 project. You can do however you like, but I decided to kinda follow in One Lone Coder footsteps by creating base class with all necessary SDL2 setup done there, and then inherited custom class from it which overrides drawing and events handling methods.

Since we'll be doing low-level pixel stuff I strongly recommend to implement some sort of scaling variable, because otherwise it will be very hard to see if our drawing was done correctly. To do this we will be rendering into texture of certain size and then blit it onto the screen with specified scale factor, that is determined by our scaling variable. Here's how it's done in `sw3d.cpp`:

```cpp
bool DrawWrapper::Init(uint16_t windowWidth,
                       uint16_t windowHeight,
                       uint16_t qualityReductionFactor)
{
  ...

  uint16_t canvasSize = std::min(windowWidth, windowHeight);
  _frameBufferSize = canvasSize / qualityReductionFactor;
  ...
  _framebuffer = SDL_CreateTexture(_renderer,
                                   SDL_PIXELFORMAT_RGBA32,
                                   SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_TARGET,
                                   _frameBufferSize,
                                   _frameBufferSize);
  ...
}
```

If we need "real" resolution we can always pass 1 to `Init()` method, but in the beginning and for debugging we will use value of about 4.

You main loop is standard: poll all events and then call method to draw, like so:

```cpp
void DrawWrapper::Run(bool debugMode)
{
  SDL_Event evt;
  ...
  while (_running)
  {
    ...
    while (SDL_PollEvent(&evt))
    {
      HandleEvent(evt);
    }

    SDL_SetRenderTarget(_renderer, _framebuffer);
    SDL_RenderClear(_renderer);

    // Our 3D rendering will happen here.
    DrawToFrameBuffer();

    SDL_SetRenderTarget(_renderer, nullptr);
    SDL_RenderClear(_renderer);

    int ok = SDL_RenderCopy(_renderer, _framebuffer, nullptr, nullptr);
    if (ok < 0)
    {
      SDL_Log("%s", SDL_GetError());
    }

    // Draw directly to the screen.
    // Can be useful for displaying text information, for example.
    DrawToScreen();

    SDL_RenderPresent(_renderer);
    ...
  }
}
```

And that's everything we need to start coding our 3D stuff.
