# LINE

OK, before we start doing things with triangles, we need to learn how to draw a line. We'll be using it in the next chapter in actual drawing of triangles, although a bit indirectly. 

We all know what lines are, we saw them hundreds of times while trying to make pixelart or doing any kind of work in graphics editor like Photoshop or GIMP. And I bet you noticed pretty early that graphics editors draw lines in a certain way: if you try to connect two points, line will cover different number of pixels and at a glance the order seems pretty unintuitive, although you can kinda understand the logic behind the pattern.

By definition line is an **infinite** collection of points, but the problem is that our screen is a **discrete** entity: it has **finite** number of points. So, given a line, we need to decide which pixels to light up along its "path". 

Enter the `"Bresenham algorithm"`.

I guess as soon as it became possible to draw stuff on the screen in the past people started to think about how to draw primitive shapes, one of which is a line. Wikipedia says that this algorithm was developed back in `1962` by the guy after which it is named - [Jack Elton Bresenham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm) - so I say it was pretty long time ago. And the fact that it's still actively used today shows its fundamental nature.

Main idea of the algorithm is pretty simple - you must light those pixels which are the closest to "real" points on "real" (mathematical) line.

OK, so let's implement this.

But hold on, one may ask: "Why do we have to deal with some algorithm from the past? Can't we just use line equation and light pixels at points which come up from the euation?". So, let's actually try it and see what happens. Let's call it "head-on approach".
